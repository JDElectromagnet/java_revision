# Java Revision Repository

ðŸ§ª A personal public repository where I practice and revise Java programming after a break.

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

- Core Java concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Code snippets and mini projects
- Practice exercises and notes

## ðŸ“Œ Note

I plan to update this repository from time to time as I revisit concepts or explore new ones.
